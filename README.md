# Professional Experience

Senior Software Engineer (DevOps)
- Led the end-to-end automation of CI/CD pipelines for Python microservices deployed on AWS using GitLab, significantly reducing manual steps, cutting deployment times by 35%, and minimizing deployment errors across multiple environments.
- Designed and implemented reusable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) modules using Terraform for Azure services (App Services, VNets, Key Vault), which enabled consistent provisioning and disaster recovery across development, QA, and production setups.
- Integrated intelligent observability using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics with alert rules, which empowered faster root cause analysis and resulted in a 25% decrease in production downtime.
- Developed and deployed Kubernetes-based Python applications using Helm charts, enabling zero-downtime deployments and supporting version rollback with blue-green strategies to improve release reliability.
- Built Prometheus and Grafana monitoring dashboards for system health and performance metrics, allowing teams to detect anomalies in real time and respond faster to infrastructure and application-level incidents.


Sofware Engineer (DevOps)
- Revamped CI/CD pipelines for Azure-hosted Python workloads by optimizing GitLab runners, introducing parallel testing, and implementing caching strategies‚Äîresulting in a 30% faster build-test-deploy cycle and reduced pipeline failures.
- Strengthened cloud security posture by configuring role-based access control (RBAC) and integrating Azure AD for user authentication across all environments, reducing access violations and audit exceptions.
- Developed Azure Functions and Logic Apps to automate operational alerts and log routing workflows, improving incident response SLAs by 28% and reducing alert fatigue with intelligent filtering.
- Re-engineered Docker image pull strategy using Azure Container Registry with regional caching and multi-layered builds, reducing latency and CI/CD bottlenecks during distributed team deployments by 22%.


System Administrator Trainee 					            
- Maintained critical Linux-based systems for development and testing teams by writing Bash scripts to automate patching, disk monitoring, log rotation, and access control‚Äîresulting in a 15% increase in uptime and reduced manual interventions.
- Automated virtual infrastructure provisioning in Azure using ARM templates and CLI scripts, decreasing onboarding setup time by over 60% and supporting faster environment spin-ups for internal DevOps projects.
- Implemented cron jobs to manage system health checks, snapshot backups, and log cleanups, ensuring 24/7 availability of critical systems and compliance with enterprise IT governance.

System Administrator Intern
- Created Bash automation scripts to handle recurring Linux system maintenance tasks such as updates, backups, and cleanup routines‚Äîstreamlining admin workflows and maintaining consistent system health throughout the internship period.
- Developed PowerShell scripts for user provisioning and Active Directory role assignments in a hybrid Windows environment, which improved access request turnaround times and reduced administrative overhead.
